# STOCK-MARKET-PREDICTION-ANALYSIS
this project is based on different stocks for the course data science to see the change in trend of stock market.
We worked in a group of 3 in this project. I was assigned to do the data visualization and trends of stock while others cleaned the webscrapped data and applied prediction models. For this project we used LSTM model to predict our closing price for the stocks. Our model showed 98-99 percent of accuracy.
